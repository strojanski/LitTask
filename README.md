# LitTask
This application runs Selenium Webdriver and takes a NBA player name as a command line argument, given upon running the jar and is designed to retrieve 
the 3-pointers average traditional split of a given player.

# Running the app
To run it open a terminal and navigate to the LIT-NBA directory and run "java -jar target/LIT-NBA-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar {NBA player}" and replace the last bracket with a 
name of a player you want the stats from. Example:  java -jar target/LIT-NBA-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Jarrett Allen
